//! Public interface and data types.

//! [`SuRaft`] serves as the primary interface to a SuRaft node,
//! facilitating all interactions with the underlying Core.
//!
//! While `Core` operates as a singleton within an application, [`SuRaft`]
//! instances are designed to be cheaply cloneable.
//! This allows multiple components within the application that require
//! interaction with `Core` to efficiently share access.

/// shutdown the SuRaft node for any reason, calling `shutdown` will do the
